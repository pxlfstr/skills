# PRM
Programmable Rectifier & Multiplier

## Overview

PRM is a multipurpose analog operator for modifying and combining signals. It's designed to cover as much functional territory as possible in a compact and intuitive 4HP package.

PRM performs many basic processing steps, including:

- Full- and half-wave rectifying
- Half-wave inversion
- Two- and four-quadrant multiplication
- Antisine/exponential waveshaping

In combination with [PGO](/docs/modules/pgo) Programmable Gain and Offset, and/or [PAB](/docs/modules/pab) Programmable Active Buffers, PRM modules can also perform complex functions such as:

- One-quadrant multiplication
- Linear and parabolic frequency doubling
- Sine/logarithmic waveshaping
- Division
- Blending and logical operations such as:
  - Minimum / AND
  - Maximum / OR
  - Difference / XOR
- Rotations
- Voltage limiting

## System Integration Advice

**Utility module** for wavefolding, multiplication, and summing, covering odd cases where the patch needs just one simple operation.

**Expander module** to add extra inputs or output processing. Extend the functionality any module. Add one next to your favorite oscillators or RGB functions to expand modulation or signal input options.

**Building block** for patching complex video synthesis functions. As low-level analog computing blocks, several P-series modules can be patched together to design a wide range of processing functions, including replicating functions from other modules. However, this level of flexibility comes at the expense of greater system size and more complex patches. Using both lower level and higher level modules is a great strategy for getting the most out of a system.

**Consider multiple PRMs**. Analog computers provide several instances of multiplier and summing operators.

---

## Connectors

The PRM design was informed by years of studying interfaces common to the building blocks of analog computers and video processing equipment. 

---

## Operation

P-series modules are precision instruments. DIY PRM modules must be calibrated before use. Assembled PRM modules are calibrated at LZX HQ, but may need adjustment from time to time. See the [Calibration](/docs/modules/prm#calibration) section below.

---

### Double Frequency / Ramp to Triangle

Similar to full-wave rectify, but scales the output to match the bipolar range of the input.

<!--
AFR note: illustration does not show ramp to triangle conversion, it shows triangle frequency doubling only. Suggest adding an additional illustration with a ramp as the source. Also, source should be labeled "source a".
-->

---

### Divide

<!-- Describe function -->

---

### Minimum / Logical AND

The lower of two input values. Corresponds to a logical **AND** operation.

An output value can only be high if A **and** B inputs are high.

$$
\min\{A, B\}
$$

$$
\text{If } A < B, \text{ then } A, \text{ else } B
$$

$$
(\;A + B - \lvert A - B \rvert\;)\;/\;2
$$

Blend mode: **Minimum**

---

### Maximum / Logical OR

The higher of two input values. Corresponds to a logical **OR** operation.

An output value will be high if either A **or** B inputs is high.

$$
\max\{A, B\}
$$

$$
\text{If } A > B, \text{ then } A, \text{ else } B
$$

$$
(\;A + B + \lvert A - B \rvert\;)\;/\;2
$$

Blend mode: **Maximum**

---

### Difference / Logical XOR

The absolute value of the difference between two input values. Corresponds to a logical **XOR** operation.

An output value will be high if the difference between A and B inputs is large. An output value will be low if the difference is small.

$$
\lvert A - B \rvert
$$

$$
\text{If } A > B, \text{ then } A - B, \text{ else } B - A
$$

Blend mode: **Difference**

---

### 2D Rotation

Rotate a figure that is defined by horizontal and vertical input signals. Typically, this means horizontal and vertical ramps. Sending the outputs of this patch to a vector display or XYZ oscilloscope allows rotation of the video raster.

## Installation

### Requirements

* EuroRack enclosure
* 12V DC or EuroRack power supply
* 2.1 mm DC barrel power cable **or** EuroRack power cable (both options included)
* Eurorack power for PRM requires a 16-pin to 10-pin ribbon cable
* Two M2.5 x 6mm mounting screws, or screws provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer
* #1 Phillips head screwdriver, or hand tool provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer

### Procedure

* Power off and disconnect the EuroRack enclosure's power supply and any attached DC adapters.
* Connect either the EuroRack Power Cable **or** the DC Barrel Power Cable to the module. Do not connect both Eurorack and DC Barrel power.
* Ensure that no mounting screws are in any holes in the area where you wish to mount the module.
* Carefully test fit the module with its attached power cable in the open space in the EuroRack enclosure. If it is obstructed by the enclosure or any internal assemblies, abort this procedure.
* Connect the disconnected end of the power cable to the power supply.
* Mount the module to the EuroRack rails using all mounting holes.
* Store the unused cable along with the product box in a safe location. 
* Power on the EuroRack enclosure and start patching.

## Calibration

### Calibration requirements

- Power source
- Bipolar +/- 1v triangle oscillator @ ~1 kHz
- Bipolar +/- 1v square oscillator @ ~10 kHz
- Oscilloscope
- Adapter cable: male mini plug to male BNC plug
- Micro-trim adjustment tool or jeweler's screwdriver
- Magnifying lens (if needed)

### Calibration procedure

1. Power down the system and unmount the module if needed.
2. Connect power to module.
3. Power up the system.
4. Set oscilloscope horizontal and vertical ranges to visualize the waveform between +/- 1v.
5. Set oscilloscope sweep activation threshold to approximately 0.5v. It may be necessary to adjust the threshold throughout the calibration process.

#### Patching the bipolar test oscillators

If using a modular system to supply the test oscillators, follow these steps:

1. Set DWO3 Oscillator 1 **Frequency Range** to **Free Lower Vertical**.
2. Set DWO3 Oscillator 1 **Frequency** knob to three o'clock, and **Freq CV Depth** knob centered. This gives a frequency of approximately 1 kHz.
3. Patch DWO3 Oscillator 1 **Triangle** output to SMX3 input **A2**.
4. Patch 1v static voltage to SMX3 input **C1**.
5. Patch SMX3 output **2** to oscilloscope.
6. Adjust SMX3 **A2** and **C2** knobs to tune the oscillator gain and bias to precisely +/- 1v.
7. Set DWO3 Oscillator 2 **Frequency Range** to **Free Upper Vertical**.
8. Set DWO3 Oscillator 2 **Frequency** knob to nine o'clock, and **Freq CV Depth** knob centered. This gives a frequency of approximately 10 kHz.
9.  Patch DWO3 Oscillator 2 **Square** output to SMX3 input **A3**.
10. Patch SMX3 output **3** to oscilloscope.
11. Adjust SMX3 **A3** and **C3** knobs to tune the oscillator gain and bias to precisely +/- 1v.

#### Rectifier submodule calibration

1. Patch the +/- 1v triangle wave to the Rectifier input
2. Patch the bottom **Rectifier** output to the oscilloscope
3. On the rear of the module, adjust the top trim pot until the folded waveform is uniform, with all peaks at 1v.

#### Multiplier submodule calibration

1. Patch the +/- 1v triangle wave to the first, top **Multipler** input.
2. Patch the +/- 1v square wave to the second, middle **Multiplier** input.
3. On the rear of the module, adjust the middle **Amplitude** pot and the bottom **Bias** pot until the multiplied waveform is uniform, ranging from -1v to +1v.
