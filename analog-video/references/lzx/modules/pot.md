## Installation

### Requirements

* EuroRack enclosure.
* Two M2.5 x 6mm mounting screws, or screws provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.
* #1 Phillips head screwdriver, or hand tool provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.

### Procedure

* Power off and disconnect the EuroRack enclosure's power supply and any attached DC adapters.
* Ensure that no mounting screws are in any holes in the area where you wish to mount the module.
* Carefully test fit the module in the open space in the EuroRack enclosure. If it is obstructed by the enclosure or any internal assemblies, abort this procedure.
* Mount the module to the EuroRack rails using all mounting holes.
* Power on the EuroRack enclosure and start patching.

### Assembly Instructions

This assembly job is recommended for intermediate level DIYers who are comfortable soldering thru hole joints in close proximity to surface mounted parts.

1. Mount and solder front facing jacks and slide potentiometer.
2. Attach the frontpanel and secure it with mounting nuts for the jacks.
