## Operation

### Understanding Cascading Input Jacks

MLT uses switched, or normalled, connections between some of its input jacks. With no cable inserted, a signal flows down from one input jack to another. This connection is overridden when a cable is inserted. Normalled inputs are indicated on the front panel with arrows.

## Installation

### Requirements

* EuroRack enclosure.
* Two M2.5 x 6mm mounting screws, or screws provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.
* #1 Phillips head screwdriver, or hand tool provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.

### Procedure

* Power off and disconnect the EuroRack enclosure's power supply and any attached DC adapters.
* Ensure that no mounting screws are in any holes in the area where you wish to mount the module.
* Carefully test fit the module in the open space in the EuroRack enclosure. If it is obstructed by the enclosure or any internal assemblies, abort this procedure.
* Mount the module to the EuroRack rails using all mounting holes.
* Power on the EuroRack enclosure and start patching.

### Assembly Instructions

This assembly job is recommended for intermediate level DIYers who are comfortable soldering thru hole joints in close proximity to surface mounted parts.

1. Mount and solder front-facing jacks.
2. Attach the front panel and secure it with mounting nuts for the jacks.
