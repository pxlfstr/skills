# SCROLLS
Dual Motion Controlled Ramp Generator

## Overview

Scrolls is a high precision motion controlled dual waveform generator for SD and HD modular video synthesis. It provides full control over two independent sets of video waveforms. Front panel switches provide access to 72 combinations of speed, waveform blanking and mirroring, and advanced motion paths ranging from elliptical orbit to random walk.

Basic generative synthesis patches begin with horizontal and vertical ramps. These define 2D Cartesian coordinates in screen space. With *motion controlled* ramps, the coordinate system itself is shifted, repositioning or animating the entire resulting pattern.

Scrolls also outputs four dedicated low frequency control voltages. These LFOs control the movement of the video waveforms. Use them to animate the patch in other ways, dancing in time with Scrolls.

Random and Journey modes conjure autonomous entities moving in screen space. Let your figure or pattern wander through the video world, or teleport in strobing patterns of random phases. In any mode, you always set the tempo. Even chaos can to step to the beat.

### Legacy

Scrolls is the third iteration of precision motion control from LZX. The first high-level animation module was the prototype **Scroll & Position Controller**. That was never released, but some of its features manifested in the Orion series module **Diver**. The design intentions of Diver and Scrolls are somewhat different. Diver's focus was generating a variety of 2D patterns, whereas Scrolls is all about procedural animation. Scrolls doesn't have a memory, but it has many fascinating innate behaviors.

## System Integration Advice

Scrolls is a unique and powerful engine for generative video synthesis. In a pure generative synthesis pipeline, Scrolls is an essential element. It can take your work in many new directions.

At the most fundamental level, Scrolls allows smooth horizontal motion. In analog generative video synthesis, vertical motion is easy. Just tune an oscillator to a frequency in the low audio range. But smooth horizontal motion can be difficult with conventional analog oscillators due to instability at high frequencies. There is a workaround involving an LFO and wavefolding, but that introduces horizontal pattern symmetry whether you like it or not.

Lacking horizontal motion, our creative options are super limited. Scrolls solves this problem with high precision digital waveforms. It's an essential tool for taking generative video beyond the basics. The various modes give you many tools for creating engaging real-time animation, and the synchronized CV outputs expand those possibilities in countless ways.

Scrolls is a primary element of a generative video system. It provides the base fabric on which rich tapestries can be woven. Other important modules in such a system might include DSG3, DWO3, Angles, Stairs, Keychain, Contour, and Stacker.

## Controls & Connectors

 

Scrolls is a rhythm source, almost like the visual version of a drum machine. It packs a great deal of functionality into a small package of 12 HP, with no menu diving.

Two identical submodules, **Ramp 1** and **Ramp 2**, provide independent inputs and outputs. 

The primary global **Mode** of Scrolls is chosen from the eight-position rotary switch in the center of the panel. This selects whether H or V signals are available from the video generator jacks, and how all motion is controlled.

Two three-position toggle switches choose other global options. The top switch selects the **Speed** mode. The switch directly below that selects the **Waveform** mode.

As the primary driver of a generative video patch, Scrolls features numerous outputs. The two bottom rows of jacks are the video waveform generators. Each Ramp submodule provides the following outputs: **Ramp** (rising), **Pulse**, **Sawtooth** (falling), and **Sine**.

Above the video outputs is a row of low frequency control voltage outputs. Each Ramp submodule features two **LFO** outputs, labeled **A** and **B**.

Per each Ramp Submodule, a bipolar **Phase** potentiometer shifts the position of the generator, or controls the motion in some other way. The Phase value can be driven by a control voltage supplied to the **CV** jack. The incoming phase CV is multiplied by the value set with the **Phase CV Depth** attenuverter potentiometer.

---

## Operation

---

## Speed

Choose from three ranges of motion speeds. The top toggle switch selects one of three modes, from left to right: **Motion Disabled**, **Slow Range**, and **Fast Range**.

 

### Motion Control Disabled

When **Speed** is set to **Motion Disabled**, the **Phase1** and **Phase2** knobs directly control the phase of the video waveforms. They also set the speed of the LFOs. In this mode, the LFOs run at the same frequencies as in **Slow Range**. However, the LFOs do not affect the video waveforms.

In **Motion Disabled** mode, the effect of turning **Phase1** and **Phase2** knobs is to offset the video waveforms. Horizontal ramps are shifted side-to-side, vertical ramps are shifted up and down.

The relationship between the knob position and the ramp position is linear in all cases except **Journey** Motion Control mode. In **Journey** mode, **Phase1** sets an angular value, which is the two-dimensional direction of an offset to both sets of video waveforms. **Phase2** sets the amount of offset to both sets of video ramps, in the direction set by **Phase1**.

### Motion Control Enabled

When **Speed** is set to **Slow Range** or **Fast Range**, the phase of the video waveforms is controlled by the LFOs. **Phase1** and **Phase2** knobs adjust the speed of the LFOs.

### Phase CV inputs

A low frequency signal supplied to **Phase1 CV** or **Phase2 CV** allows automation of the phase of the video waveforms and/or the LFO frequencies. The value of the incoming voltage is multiplied by the associated **Phase CV Depth** attenuverter, and added to the value of the associated Phase knob.

The same rules apply whether or not Phase receives a control voltage. In **Motion Disabled** mode, the LFOs don't affect the video waveforms. In **Slow Range** or **Fast Range** modes, the video waveforms are modulated by the LFOs.

:::note
The **Phase CV** inputs can technically accept any LZX-compatible voltage, but the Scrolls engine is not designed for video-rate modulation, or even for instantaneous transitions. There's always a split-second slew applied to any change in Phase.

For example, if you plug a video signal into a **Phase CV** input, you'll probably get chaotic results. This may be interesting and useful as an effect, but you can't modulate with a video image like you can with an analog oscillator such as DWO3. Or if you plug a low frequency square wave into **Phase CV**, you won't get video waveforms instantly jumping from one position to another, you'll get snappy movements between two positions.

## Waveform

Choose from three waveform modes. The toggle switch selects one of three modes, from left to right: **Wrap**, **Blank**, and **Mirror**. 

### Wrap

The ramp phase scrolls continuously, repeating across the screen.

### Blank

The ramp phase can be shifted entirely offscreen.

### Mirror

The ramp phase inverts on every other cycle. The result is a scrolling virtual canvas, double the width and double the height of the video image.

 

:::note
In HD timing formats, a 20ns black line is visible when the ramp reflects from positive to negative slopes. This is known behavior.

## Motion Control Modes

### HH: Double Horizontal

Both **Ramp 1** and **Ramp 2** video waveforms are horizontal, with separate **Phase** controls.

**LFO A** is a sine wave. **LFO B** is a rising ramp in phase with LFO A, such that the lowest values of the two oscillators happen at the same time.

---

### VV: Double Vertical

Both **Ramp 1** and **Ramp 2** video waveforms are vertical, with separate **Phase** controls.

**LFO A** is a sine wave. **LFO B** is a rising ramp in phase with LFO A, such that the lowest values of the two oscillators happen at the same time.

---

### HV: Horizontal & Vertical

**Ramp 1** video waveforms are horizontal, **Ramp 2** video waveforms are vertical.

**LFO A** is a sine wave. **LFO B** is a rising ramp in phase with LFO A, such that the lowest values of the two oscillators happen at the same time.

---

### PP: Ping Pong

**Ramp 1** video waveforms are horizontal, **Ramp 2** is vertical. Motion uses triangle waves, for the bouncing DVD player logo effect.

**LFO A** is a triangle wave. **LFO B** is a sine wave, in phase with LFO A.

---

### O: Orbital

**Ramp 1** video waveforms are horizontal, **Ramp 2** video waveforms are vertical. Motion uses a quadrature sine wave generator to animate the video waveforms in an elliptical orbit matching the aspect ratio of the video frame. **Phase 1** controls speed, **Phase 2** controls depth.

**LFO A** and **LFO B** are sine waves. **LFO B** is 90 degrees out of phase relative to LFO A.

---

### J: Journey

**Ramp 1** video waveforms are horizontal, Ramp 2 video waveforms are vertical. Motion is similar to HV mode, but speed and direction are based on polar coordinates instead of a Cartesian XY grid. **Phase 1** controls the angular direction of motion, **Phase 2** controls speed.

**LFO A** and **LFO B** are sine waves. **LFO B** is 90 degrees out of phase relative to LFO A. The frequency of both LFOs is affected by both Phase parameters, in a complex nonlinear relationship resulting from the polar coordinates.

:::note
In journey mode, increasing the Phase may have the counterintuitive result of decreasing the frequency of LFOs.
:::

 

---

### C: Corner

**Ramp 1** video waveform is horizontal, **Ramp 2** is vertical. **Phase 1** controls speed, **Phase 2** controls depth. Motion is similar to Orbital mode, but uses slewed trapezoid waveforms rather than sines. This gives pleasing &ldquo;slow-out, slow-in&rdquo; changes in speed.

**LFO A** and **LFO B** are &ldquo;s-curve&rdquo; slewed trapezoid waves. **LFO B** is 90 degrees out of phase relative to LFO A.

---

### R?: Random

**Ramp 1** video waveform is horizontal, **Ramp 2** is vertical. **Phase 1** controls speed. **Phase 2** controls depth, which is the amplitude of the chaotic waveforms.

Two chaotic modes are available, determined by the position of the **Phase 2** knob. In the counterclockwise range to the left of 12 o'clock, the random values are punctuated by sudden movements and periods of momentary stillness. In the clockwise range to the right of 12 o'clock, the random values are smoothly interpolated, similar to the fluctuating random voltages found in audio modules such as the Buchla 266 Source of Uncertainty.

**LFO A** and **LFO B** are independent chaotic waveforms.
