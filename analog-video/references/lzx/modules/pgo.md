# PGO
Programmable Gain & Offset

## Overview

PGO is a multipurpose analog operator for adding and subtracting signals. It's designed to cover as much functional territory as possible in a compact and intuitive 4HP package.

PGO performs many basic processing steps such as:

- Amplify
- Attenuate
- Invert
- Add
- Subtract
- Average
- Bias (offset / level shift)

### Front Panel Options

PGO ships with a black front panel installed. Red, green and blue panels are also included.

All front panels are printed on both sides, allowing a choice of top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top signal flow. This gives great flexibility in designing modular systems.

<!--
AFR note: recommend adding an illustration of the reverse sides of the four panels.

## System Integration Advice

- **Utility** module for mixing and level shifting, covering cases where the patch needs just one simple operation.
- **Expander** to augment the functionality of other modules. Add more inputs. Process signals before or after any module. To expand modulation or signal input options, add PGO's next to your favorite high-level functions such as oscillators or shape generators.
- **Building block** for patching complex video synthesis functions. As low level analog computing blocks, several PGO's can be patched together to design a wide range of processing functions, including replicating functions from other modules. This level of flexibility comes at the expense of greater system size and more complex patches. Using both low-level and high-level modules is a great strategy for getting the most out of a system.
- **The more, the merrier.** More PGO's doesn't add possibilities, it multiplies them. PGO is a functional unit of an analog computer specialized for video. To operate as a traditional analog computer, a system requires multiple instances of summing and difference amplifiers. Bidirectional voltage conversion would require two PGO's. A triple color space function requires three. More complex vector functions require eight or more.

---

## Connectors

The PGO design was informed by years of studying interfaces common to the building blocks of analog computers and video processing equipment. 

---

## Operation

PGO sits at a lower level of abstraction than more complex modules like video shape generators and video keyers. The synthesist is granted full access to the signal path, and the freedom to program a function in discrete steps.

PGO is a *patch-programmable* operator. Its overall function is determined by patch connections rather than switch positions or variable voltages. Connections to specific input and output jacks define operations at different mixing ratios and amounts of gain.

### Understanding Cascading Input Jacks

PGO uses switched, or normalled, connections between some of its input jacks. With no cable inserted, a signal flows from one input jack to another. This connection is overridden when a cable is inserted. Normalled inputs are indicated on the front panel with arrows.

### Difference Amplifier

A difference amplifier subtracts one voltage from another. It is similar to a differential amplifier, but is specifically optimized to subtract one voltage from another with accuracy.  PGO's amplifier is fully differential, meaning that it has both positive and negative outputs.  

In PGO's implementation, the positive input and negative input of the difference amplifier are each preceded by a four-input summing amplifier stage. This configuration allows the user to simultaneously add and subtract multiple signals. Due to the cascading input switches, the gain of each side of the difference amplifier may be programmed by which jacks are patched and which jacks are left open.

### Voltage Reference

PGO provides a static voltage reference of 1V at its output jack. This level corresponds to a luminance value of white, or to the 100% brightness level of an RGB channel. This reference voltage may be patched anywhere in your system, or to the inputs on PGO.

## Example Patches

### Buffer

Buffer the input signal with a unity gain of 1.0. Due to the module's propagation delay, it can be used to add slight delays in the video processing path, resulting in the picture shifting slightly to the right.

---

### Amplifiy

Amplify the input signal with a gain of 2.

---

### Attenuate

Attenuate the input signal with a gain of 0.5.

---

### Invert

Invert the arithmetic sign of the input signal. Positive voltages are converted to negative voltages, or vice versa.

---

### Negative

Convert a unipolar signal to negative by subtracting it from 1V. Useful for inverting keys, logic and RGB channels. An input signal ranging from zero to one results in an inverted output ranging from one to zero.

---

### Subtract

Subtract one input from another.

---

### Add

Calculate the sum of two input signals.

---

### Average

Calculate the average of two input signals.

---

### Unipolar Modulation

Subtract a modulator from a primary signal, where both are unipolar, from zero to +1V. The primary signal *source a* passes unmodified when the modulating signal *source b* is at its midpoint of 0.5V. As a ramp shifter, *source a* is the input ramp, and *source b* is the positioning control voltage. As a brightness processor, *source a* is a unipolar color channel such as luma, red, green, or blue, and *source b* is the brightness adjustment.

---

### Weighted Mixer

Calculate a 3:1 weighted sum of two inputs, with 3 parts of *source a* for every 1 part of *source b*.

---

### Compressed Mixer

Calculate the sum of four input signals and attenuate the mix to a value of one half. This is a common scenario to prevent clipping when mixing more than two input signals.

---

### Bipolar to Unipolar

Convert a +/-1V bipolar signal to the 0-1V unipolar range.

---

### Unipolar to Bipolar

Convert a 0-1V unipolar signal to the +/-1V bipolar range.

---

<!--

AFR note: suggest revising these illustrations.

Differential to Single-ended should have two separate input frames, one for each signal. Right now the two inputs are superimposed in the same frame. This is confusing.

Likewise with Single-ended to differential, it should have two separate output frames, one for each signal.

### Differential to Single-ended

Convert a differential input signal to a single-ended output signal. In a differential signal, information is encoded as the difference between a matched pair of separate signals. For example, balanced audio rejects noise on cable runs by sending both a positive and a phase-inverted negative signal on two conductors. Video chroma can be encoded as the difference between two color primaries, such as Pb and Pr, or I and Q. 

---

### Single-ended to Differential

Convert a single-ended input signal to a differential output signal. One possible application of differential outputs on PGO would be positive and negative versions of the same signal, such as luminance keys. Both signals will have the same amount of propagation delay, allowing precise horizontal alignment of positive and negative masks.

## Functional Testing

The following tests are designed to verify the module is functioning as expected after assembly. If you are concerned your module is not operating properly, these tests may be used for self verification before a repair is initiated.  It is also best practice to perform a functional test when selling or purchasing a module on the secondhand market.

### Requirements

- Voltmeter, multimeter or oscilloscope
- 12V power supply or EuroRack power supply
- Patch cables

### Setup

- Connect the module to power and turn on the power supply
- Prepare to probe the disconnected end of a patch cable -- in these tests, the positive probe should make contact with the tip of the plug, and the negative probe or grounding clip should make contact with the sleeve of the plug.

### Tests

#### T1. Test voltage reference

- Verify that the Voltage Reference Out is within +/-2% of 1.00V.

#### T2. Test difference amplifier positive inputs

- Connect a cable from the voltage reference output to Difference Amplifier In1+
- Verify that Difference Amplifier Out+ is within +/-2% of +2V
- Verify that Difference Amplifier Out- is within +/-2% of -2V

#### T3. Test difference amplifier negative inputs

- Connect a cable from the voltage reference output to Difference Amplifier In 1-
- Verify that Difference Amplifier Out+ is within +/-2% of -2V
- Verify that Difference Amplifier Out- is within +/-2% of +2V

This concludes functional testing. If all steps starting with *Verify...* passed their conditions, then PGO is operating within expected parameters.
